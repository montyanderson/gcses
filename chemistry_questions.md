# Chemistry Questions

## Chapter 1

### 1) What is the name given to each of the following changes of state?

&deg; solid to liquid - &deg;&deg;melting&deg;&deg;
&deg; liquid to solid - &deg;&deg;freezing&deg;&deg;
&deg; solid to gas - &deg;&deg;sublimation&deg;&deg;
&deg; gas to solid - &deg;&deg;sublimation&deg;&deg;

( solid to gas and gas to solid are both called &deg;&deg;sublimation&deg;&deg;)

### 2)

#### b) Describe the difference between the arrangement of the particles in a solid, a liquid, and a gas.

Particles in a solid are tightly packed together in a uniform fashion and vibrate around a fixed point, particles in a liquid as less tightly packed together with more movement, particles in gas are completely free with large amounts of space between particles.

#### c) The change of state from a liquid to a gas can be either evaporation or boiling. Explain the difference between evaporation and boiling.

Boiling is a &deg;&deg;fast&deg;&deg; process that occours at a &deg;&deg;specific temperature&deg;&deg;, &deg;&deg;throughout the liquid&deg;&deg; where &deg;&deg;bubbles occour&deg;&deg;. A &deg;&deg;specific source of energy&deg;&deg; is needed.

Evaporation is a &deg;&deg;slow&deg;&deg; process that occours at &deg;&deg;all temperatures&deg;&deg;, &deg;&deg;only on the exposed surface of the liquid&deg;&deg;, &deg;&deg;no bubbles are formed&deg;&deg;. Energy is supplied by &deg;&deg;the surroundings&deg;&deg;.

#### d) Some liquids are stored in sealed bottles for a very long time - decades or more. Explain why they don't evaporate.

In a sealed container, particles return and stick to the container at the same rate as particles are evaporating.


### 3) The questions refer to the table below

#### a) Write down the physical states of each substance at 20&deg;C

&deg; a - gas
&deg; b - liquid
&deg; c - solid
&deg; d - liquid
&deg; e - solid

#### b) Which substance has the strongest attractions between it's particles?

C. It doesn't sublime until a very high temperature and thus has the strongest attractions between its partiles.

#### c) Which substance has the weakest attractions between it's partiles?

A. It melts and boils as very low temperatures and thus doesn't require much energy to break the attractions.

#### d) Which substance has the greatest distance between its particles at 20&deg;C?

A. It's the only gas.

#### e) Why is no boiling point given for substance C?

It sublimes, meaning it goes directly from a solid to a gas (without ever becoming a liquid)

#### f) Which liquid substance would evaporate most quickly in the open air at 20&deg;C?

D. It has the lowest boiling point of the two liquids;

### 4) Refer to Figure 1.11, which shows the diffusion experiment.
