## Chapter 1

### 1) What is the name given to each of the following changes of state?

* solid to liquid - **melting**
* liquid to solid - **freezing**
* solid to gas - **sublimation**
* gas to solid - **sublimation**

( solid to gas and gas to solid are both called **sublimation**)

### 2)

#### b) Describe the difference between the arrangement of the particles in a solid, a liquid, and a gas.

Particles in a solid are tightly packed together in a uniform fashion and vibrate around a fixed point, particles in a liquid as less tightly packed together with more movement, particles in gas are completely free with large amounts of space between particles.

#### c) The change of state from a liquid to a gas can be either evaporation or boiling. Explain the difference between evaporation and boiling.

Boiling is a **fast** process that occours at a **specific temperature**, **throughout the liquid** where **bubbles occour**. A **specific source of energy** is needed.

Evaporation is a **slow** process that occours at **all temperatures**, **only on the exposed surface of the liquid**, **no bubbles are formed**. Energy is supplied by **the surroundings**.

#### d) Some liquids are stored in sealed bottles for a very long time - decades or more. Explain why they don't evaporate.

In a sealed container, particles return and stick to the container at the same rate as particles are evaporating.


### 3) The questions refer to the table below

#### a) Write down the physical states of each substance at 20&deg;C

* a - gas
* b - liquid
* c - solid
* d - liquid
* e - solid

#### b) Which substance has the strongest attractions between it's particles?

C. It doesn't sublime until a very high temperature and thus has the strongest attractions between its partiles.

#### c) Which substance has the weakest attractions between it's partiles?

A. It melts and boils as very low temperatures and thus doesn't require much energy to break the attractions.

#### d) Which substance has the greatest distance between its particles at 20&deg;C?

A. It's the only gas.

#### e) Why is no boiling point given for substance C?

It sublimes, meaning it goes directly from a solid to a gas (without ever becoming a liquid)

#### f) Which liquid substance would evaporate most quickly in the open air at 20&deg;C?

D. It has the lowest boiling point of the two liquids;

### 4) Refer to Figure 1.11, which shows the diffusion experiment.

#### a) Explain why the ring takes little time to form

The ammonia and hydrogen chloride particles collide with the air particles the entire way.

#### b) If you heat a gas, what effect will thus have on the movement of the particles?

The particles will move faster.

#### c) In light of your answer **(b)**, what different would you find if you did this experiment outside on a day when the temperature was 2&deg;C instead of a warm lab at 25&deg;C?

The ring would be at the same place, but it would take more time to appear, as the gas particles would be moving more slowly.

#### d) Explain why the ring was formed nearer the hydrochloric acid end of the tube.

The ring formed near the hydrochloric acid end of the tube as the ammonia clearly travels more quickly than the hydrochloric acid.
