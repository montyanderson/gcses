# Chemistry Questions

**Official answers are [here](https://www.scribd.com/doc/251596738/Edexcel-IGCSE-Chemistry-Student-s-Book-Answers)**

## Chapter 1

### 1) What is the name given to each of the following changes of state?

* solid to liquid - **melting**
* liquid to solid - **freezing**
* solid to gas - **sublimation**
* gas to solid - **sublimation**

( solid to gas and gas to solid are both called **sublimation**)

### 2)

#### b) Describe the difference between the arrangement of the particles in a solid, a liquid, and a gas.

Particles in a solid are tightly packed together in a uniform fashion and vibrate around a fixed point, particles in a liquid as less tightly packed together with more movement, particles in gas are completely free with large amounts of space between particles.

#### c) The change of state from a liquid to a gas can be either evaporation or boiling. Explain the difference between evaporation and boiling.

Boiling is a **fast** process that occours at a **specific temperature**, **throughout the liquid** where **bubbles occour**. A **specific source of energy** is needed.

Evaporation is a **slow** process that occours at **all temperatures**, **only on the exposed surface of the liquid**, **no bubbles are formed**. Energy is supplied by **the surroundings**.

#### d) Some liquids are stored in sealed bottles for a very long time - decades or more. Explain why they don't evaporate.

In a sealed container, particles return and stick to the container at the same rate as particles are evaporating.


### 3) The questions refer to the table below

#### a) Write down the physical states of each substance at 20&deg;C

* a - gas
* b - liquid
* c - solid
* d - liquid
* e - solid

#### b) Which substance has the strongest attractions between it's particles?

C. It doesn't sublime until a very high temperature and thus has the strongest attractions between its partiles.

#### c) Which substance has the weakest attractions between it's partiles?

A. It melts and boils as very low temperatures and thus doesn't require much energy to break the attractions.

#### d) Which substance has the greatest distance between its particles at 20&deg;C?

A. It's the only gas.

#### e) Why is no boiling point given for substance C?

It sublimes, meaning it goes directly from a solid to a gas (without ever becoming a liquid)

#### f) Which liquid substance would evaporate most quickly in the open air at 20&deg;C?

D. It has the lowest boiling point of the two liquids;

### 4) Refer to Figure 1.11, which shows the diffusion experiment.

#### a) Explain why the ring takes little time to form

The ammonia and hydrogen chloride particles collide with the air particles the entire way.

#### b) If you heat a gas, what effect will thus have on the movement of the particles?

The particles will move faster.

#### c) In light of your answer **(b)**, what different would you find if you did this experiment outside on a day when the temperature was 2&deg;C instead of a warm lab at 25&deg;C?

The ring would be at the same place, but it would take more time to appear, as the gas particles would be moving more slowly.

#### d) Explain why the ring was formed nearer the hydrochloric acid end of the tube.

The ring formed near the hydrochloric acid end of the tube as the ammonia clearly travels more quickly than the hydrochloric acid.

## Chapter 2

### 1) Fluorine atoms have a mass number of 19

#### a) Use the Periodic Table to find the atomic number of fluorine

9.

#### b) Explain what mass number means

The "mass number" is the sum of the protons and the neutrons.

#### c) Write down the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in a fluorine atom

Protons - 9
Neutrons - 10
Electrons - 9

### 2) Work out the numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons in each of the following atoms:

#### a) <sup>56</sup><sub>26</sub>Fe

26p, 30n, 26e

#### b) <sup>93</sup><sub>41</sub>Nb

41p, 52n, 41e

#### c) <sup>235</sup><sub>92</sub>U

92p, 143n, 92e

### 3) Chlorine has two isotopes, chlorine-35 and chlorine-37.

#### a) What are isotopes?

Isotopes are forms of the same element (same amount of protons), but with different amounts of neutrons.

#### b) Write down the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the two isotopes.

#### c) Write down the arrangement of the electrons in each of the two isotopes

* Chlorine-35 - 2, 8, 7
* Chlorine-37 - 2, 8, 7

### 4) Draw diagrams to show the arrangement of the electrons in

#### a) sodium

2, 8, 1

#### b) silicon

2, 8, 4

#### c) sulfur

2, 8, 6

### Draw diagrams to show the arrangement of the electrons in

#### a) arsenic

5

#### b) bromine

7

#### c) tin

4

#### d) xenon

8

### The questions refer to the electronic structures below. Don't worry if some of these are unfamiliar to you. All of these are the electronic structures of neutral atoms.

* A 2, 4
* B 2, 8, 8
* C 2, 8, 18, 18, 7
* D 2, 8, 18
* E 2, 8, 8, 2
* F 2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 4

#### a) Which of these atoms are in group 4 of the Periodic Table?

A, F

#### b) Which of these structures represents carbon?

A - the electrons sum to the atomic number of carbon (6)

#### c) Which of these structures represents an element in group 7 of the periodic table?

C - the number of electrons in the outer layer is 7

#### d) Which of these structures represent noble gases?

B - the number of electrons in the outer shell is 8, which corrosponds to group 0 (the noble gases)

#### e) Name element E

Calcium

#### f) How many protons does element F have? Name the element.

&nbsp;82.

#### g) Element G has one more electron than element B. Draw a diagram to show how the electrons are arranged in an atom of G.
