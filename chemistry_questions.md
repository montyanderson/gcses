## Chapter 1

### 1) What is the name given to each of the following changes of state?

* solid to liquid - **melting**
* liquid to solid - **freezing**
* solid to gas - **sublimation**
* gas to solid - **sublimation**

( solid to gas and gas to solid are both called **sublimation**)

### 2)

#### b) Describe the difference between the arrangement of the particles in a solid, a liquid, and a gas.

Particles in a solid are tightly packed together in a uniform fashion and vibrate around a fixed point, particles in a liquid as less tightly packed together with more movement, particles in gas are completely free with large amounts of space between particles.

#### c) The change of state from a liquid to a gas can be either evaporation or boiling. Explain the difference between evaporation and boiling.

Boiling is a **fast** process that occours at a **specific temperature**, **throughout the liquid** where **bubbles occour**. A **specific source of energy** is needed.

Evaporation is a **slow** process that occours at **all temperatures**, **only on the exposed surface of the liquid**, **no bubbles are formed**. Energy is supplied by **the surroundings**.

#### d) Some liquids are stored in sealed bottles for a very long time - decades or more. Explain why they don't evaporate.

In a sealed container, particles return and stick to the container at the same rate as particles are evaporating.


### 3) The questions refer to the table below

#### a) Write down the physical states of each substance at 20&deg;C

* a - gas
* b - liquid
* c - solid
* d - liquid
* e - solid

#### b) Which substance has the strongest attractions between it's particles?

C. It doesn't sublime until a very high temperature and thus has the strongest attractions between its partiles.

#### c) Which substance has the weakest attractions between it's partiles?

A. It melts and boils as very low temperatures and thus doesn't require much energy to break the attractions.

#### d) Which substance has the greatest distance between its particles at 20&deg;C?

A. It's the only gas.

#### e) Why is no boiling point given for substance C?

It sublimes, meaning it goes directly from a solid to a gas (without ever becoming a liquid)

#### f) Which liquid substance would evaporate most quickly in the open air at 20&deg;C?

D. It has the lowest boiling point of the two liquids;

### 4) Refer to Figure 1.11, which shows the diffusion experiment.
