# Chemistry Questions

**Official answers are [here](https://www.scribd.com/doc/251596738/Edexcel-IGCSE-Chemistry-Student-s-Book-Answers)**

## Chapter 1

### 1. What is the name given to each of the following changes of state?

* solid to liquid - **melting**
* liquid to solid - **freezing**
* solid to gas - **sublimation**
* gas to solid - **sublimation**

( solid to gas and gas to solid are both called **sublimation**)

### 2.

#### b) Describe the difference between the arrangement of the particles in a solid, a liquid, and a gas.

Particles in a solid are tightly packed together in a uniform fashion and vibrate around a fixed point, particles in a liquid as less tightly packed together with more movement, particles in gas are completely free with large amounts of space between particles.

#### c) The change of state from a liquid to a gas can be either evaporation or boiling. Explain the difference between evaporation and boiling.

Boiling is a **fast** process that occours at a **specific temperature**, **throughout the liquid** where **bubbles occour**. A **specific source of energy** is needed.

Evaporation is a **slow** process that occours at **all temperatures**, **only on the exposed surface of the liquid**, **no bubbles are formed**. Energy is supplied by **the surroundings**.

#### d) Some liquids are stored in sealed bottles for a very long time - decades or more. Explain why they don't evaporate.

In a sealed container, particles return and stick to the container at the same rate as particles are evaporating.


### 3. The questions refer to the table below

#### a) Write down the physical states of each substance at 20&deg;C

* a - gas
* b - liquid
* c - solid
* d - liquid
* e - solid

#### b) Which substance has the strongest attractions between it's particles?

C. It doesn't sublime until a very high temperature and thus has the strongest attractions between its partiles.

#### c) Which substance has the weakest attractions between it's partiles?

A. It melts and boils as very low temperatures and thus doesn't require much energy to break the attractions.

#### d) Which substance has the greatest distance between its particles at 20&deg;C?

A. It's the only gas.

#### e) Why is no boiling point given for substance C?

It sublimes, meaning it goes directly from a solid to a gas (without ever becoming a liquid)

#### f) Which liquid substance would evaporate most quickly in the open air at 20&deg;C?

D. It has the lowest boiling point of the two liquids;

### 4. Refer to Figure 1.11, which shows the diffusion experiment.

#### a) Explain why the ring takes little time to form

The ammonia and hydrogen chloride particles collide with the air particles the entire way.

#### b) If you heat a gas, what effect will thus have on the movement of the particles?

The particles will move faster.

#### c) In light of your answer **(b)**, what different would you find if you did this experiment outside on a day when the temperature was 2&deg;C instead of a warm lab at 25&deg;C?

The ring would be at the same place, but it would take more time to appear, as the gas particles would be moving more slowly.

#### d) Explain why the ring was formed nearer the hydrochloric acid end of the tube.

The ring formed near the hydrochloric acid end of the tube as the ammonia clearly travels more quickly than the hydrochloric acid.

## Chapter 2

## Chapter 3

### 3.

#### a) What is meant by **(i)** an ion; **(ii)** an ionic bond?

An ion is an atom or molecule with a net electrical charge due to loosing or gaining an electrical atom.

An ionic bond is one where an electron is shared between two atoms.

#### b) In each of the following cases, write down the electronic structures of the original atoms, then explain (in words or diagrams) what happens when:

##### (i) sodium bonds with chlorine to make sodium chloride

Na 1e + Cl 7e => Na 0e + Cl 8e

##### (ii) lithium bonds with oxygen to make lithium oxide

Li 1e + O 6e => Li 0e + O 6e

##### (iii) magnesium bonds with fluorine to make magnesium fluoride

Mg 2e + F 7e => Mg 8e + F 8e

### 4.

#### a) A solid metal is often described as having 'an array of positive ions in a sea of electrons'. Write down the electronic structure of a magnesium atom and use it to explain what this phrase means.

This phrase is used to show that when you have a solid metal, the atoms loose some of their electrons into the surroundings, and thus gain a posititve charge.

#### b) Metallic bonds are not fully broken until the metal has first melted and then boiled. The boiling points of sodium, magnesium, and aluminium are 890&deg;C, 1110&deg;C, and 2470&deg;C, respectively. What does this suggest about the strengths of the metallic bonds in these three elements?

The higher the temperature needed to boil, the higher the energy that is typically needed to break the bond, thus they are very strong. The bonds get consecutively stronger from sodium to magnesium to aluminium.

#### c) Find these metals in the Periodic Table, and suggest why the boiling points show this pattern.

As the boiling points increase (with these three elements), the horizontal position in the periodic table also increases. This shows that they have more outer electrons to give and thus create a better mettalic bond which requires more energy to break.

#### d) Assuming that an electric current is simply a flow of electrons, suggest why all these elements are good conductors of electricity.

They all have delocalized electrons, which are mobile.

### 5. The table below gives details of the boiling temperatures of some substances made up of covalent molecules. Arrange these substances in increasing order of the strength of their intermolecular attractions.

### 6) Boron and aluminium are both in Group 3 of the Periodic Table. Both form compounds with fluorine, (BF<sub>3</sub> and AlF<sub>3</sub>). Unusually for elements found in the same group of the Periodic Table, their compounds are bonded differently. BF<sub>3</sub> is covalent, whereas AlF<sub>3</sub> is a straightforward ionic compound.

#### b) Explain, using diagrams or otherwise, the origin of ionic bonding in AlF<sub>3</sub>.

As Al (aluminium) has 5 outer electrons, and F (fluorine) has 3, having 3 F atoms allows Al to pull the atoms inwards to create a set of 8.

#### c) BF<sub>3</sub> is described as an electron-deficient compound. What do you think that might mean?

It could mean that it doesn't have enough electrons and could be unstable as a result.

## Chapter 4

### 1.

#### b) Chose one physical property where diamond and graphite have physical characteristics, and any two physical properties where they are different. Use your diagrams to explain the similarity and the differences.

Similarity - they're both made of carbon

Differences - Diamond is harder than graphite. Graphite is darker in colour.

### 2.

#### a) Most metals are malleable and ductile. Explain what happens to the particles in a metal when it is subjected to a large stress.

The particles slide over each other, into new positions.

#### b) State any other physical property of metals, and explain how it arises from the metallic structure.

Metals are generally very conductive, this is because of the sea of electrons that sourrounds them.

#### c) Alloys are mixtures of metals. Explain why an alloy is usually harder than indiviudal metals that make it up.

In an alloy, the different metal atoms will have different sizes, and this makes it harder for layers to slide i.e. harder.

### 3. Explain why sodium chloride **a)** has a higher melting point; **b)** has brittle crystals; **c)** is soluble in water.

a) It has a higher melting point because it's a **giant ionic structure**, which means it has a large lattice with strong attractions. This means it requires more energy to break and thus at a higher melting point.

b) It has brittle crystals because the atoms can't slide onto the next layer, due to their complex crystaline structure.

c) *Ionic substances tend to be soluble in water.*

### 4. Decide what sort of structure each of the following substances is most likely to have. You can choose between: **giant metallic structure**, **giant covalent structure**, **giant ionic structure**, **molecular structure**.

Giant covalent bond.

#### b) Substance B is a colourless gas.

Molecular.

#### c) Substance C is a yellow solid with a low melting point of 113&deg;C. It doesn't conduct electricity and is insoluble in water.

Molecular.

#### d) Substance D forms brittle orange crystals which melt at 398&deg;C. D dissolves freely in water to give an orange solution.

Giant ionic structure.

#### e) Substance E is a pinkish-brown flexible solid. It conducts electricity.

Giant metallic structure.

#### f) Substance F is a liquid with a boiling point of 80&deg;C. It is insoluble in water.

Molecular.

#### g) Substance G is a silvery solid which melts at 660&deg;C. It is used in overhead power cables.

Giant metallic.

#### h) Substance H is a glassy solid which melts at 450&deg;C and boils at 1860&deg;C. It doesn't conduct electricity even when molten, but reacts very slowly with water.

Giant covalent.

### 5. Look at the structure of silicon dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>. Silicon-oxygen bonds are strong.

#### a) Would you expect silicon dioxide to be a solid, liquid, or gas? Explain your answer.

It's a 3-dimensional covalent structure, so I'd expect it to be a solid.

#### b) Would you expect silicon dioxide to be hard or soft?

Hard, as it's 3-dimensional structures means it's brittle.

#### c) Silicon dioxide doesn't react with water, but would you expect silicon dioxide to dissolve in water?

No, as giant covalent structures aren't soluble in water.

#### d) By doing an internet or book search, find out where silicon dioxide occurs in nature. Are you answers (a-c) consistent to what you've found out? Explain why.
