# Shoot; Stab; Murder - A look at video games.

Computer games, since their birth in the seventies, have stolen the concentration of our youngest generation, leaving behind a trail of parental worry and confusion. For this to be explored more, one must dig deeper.

Many computer games use repititon to lock into the minds of impressioniable youth, giving biological satification similar to that of the caveman's natural human activities. It's with this technique that the *computer games industry* creates its sales- in 2014, the *US Games Industry* was valued at around $20.5 billion, with record-breaking exponential growth. Both children and adults report feelings of addiction, spanning from mild disconnection with their surroudings to constant impulses to return to their virtual world.

As grades of 16-18 year olds plumet nation-wide, one must wonder to what extent we must place the blame on video games. In 2015 *The Guardian* carried out a survey, finding that 25% of children aged 14-19 spent *more than five or six hours* engaging in video games or the internet- an increase from 15% in 2010.

Many video games use the portrayal and enactment of violence as their key selling feature. For instance, *Grant Theft Auto V*, the fourth highest selling video game of all time, requires players to shoot, stab, murder, and steal from gang members, innocent civilians, prositutes, and strippers. Further more, the game displays an ever increasing level of simulated reality, presenting children a twisted, violence-dominated world, visually indifferent from their own. In 2012, a study was conducted by the *Royal Institute of Official Studies*, that found virtual brutality to be conceptually indifferent to that of real, physical inhumanity. Reportedly, the same neural pathways are engaged with both types. *

Resultantly, children should be monitored on their use of video games. In light of the content of video games, parents should inspect all nuances of the games their children whish to play, and read online about other parent's experiences of them, to gain a complete understanding. Only then, should a child be allowed free reign.
