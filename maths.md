a<sup>b</sup> / a<sup>c</sup> = a<sup>b - c</sup>

a<sup>b</sup> * a<sup>c</sup> = a<sup>b + c</sup>

## Pre-calculus

* y = mx + c
* m = slope
* c = coefficient

* Slope = m = &Delta;y / &Delta;x = (y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>0</sub>) / (x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>0</sub>)

* A straight line will always have a constant slope.

* A line that intersects two points on a curve is known as a *secant* line.

But how to we find out the instantaneous rate of change?

### Secant Line Question

* **A curve has an equation *y = ln x* and passes through the points *P = (e, 1)* and *Q = (x, ln x)***.

* ** Write an expression in *x* that gives the slope of the secant joining *P* and *Q*.**

* Equation = y = ln(x)

* Point P = (e, 1)
1 = ln(e)

* Point Q = (x, ln x)
ln(x) = ln(x)

* (x - e)
* (ln(x) - 1)

## Calculus

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54_XRjHhZzI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54_XRjHhZzI)

Two goals of Calculus:

* Find the slope (tangent) at the point of a curve

* Find the area under a curve between two points

### Terminology

* **Secant Line** a

### Tangent (Slope)

* If you give me any arbitrary curve and a point (P), I want to find the tangent (slope) at that point.

How do you make the equasion of a line, when you only have a single point?
