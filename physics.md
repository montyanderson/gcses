## Infrared Radiation

* Heat can be transferred from place to place by conduction, convection, and radiation.

* Light, shiny surfaces **reflect** infrared radiation.

## Kinetic Theory

* Kinetic particle theory explains the properties of the different states of matter.

* The solids in solids, liquids, and gases have different amounts of energy.

## Conduction

* Heat energy can move through a substance by conduction.

* Metals are typically good conductors of heat, whereas non-metals and gases are usually poor conductors of heat.

### Heat conduction in metals

* The electrons in a piece of metal can leave their atoms, and move about in the metal as free (discrete) electrons.

* The parts of metal now left behind are **charged metal ions**. The ions are packed close together and vibrate continually.
