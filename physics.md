## Infrared Radiation

* Heat can be transferred from place to place by conduction, convection, and radiation.

* Light, shiny surfaces **reflect** infrared radiation.

## Kinetic Theory

* Kinetic particle theory explains the properties of the different states of matter.

* The solids in solids, liquids, and gases have different amounts of energy.

## Conduction

* Heat energy can move through a substance by conduction.

* Metals are typically good conductors of heat, whereas non-metals and gases are usually poor conductors of heat.

### Heat conduction in metals

* The electrons in a piece of metal can leave their atoms, and move about in the metal as free (discrete) electrons.

* The parts of metal now left behind are **charged metal ions**. The ions are packed close together and vibrate continually.

* The hotter the metal, the more kinetic energy these vibrations have. The kinetic energy is then transferred from the hot parts of the metal to the cooler parts by the free electrons. These move through the structure of the metal, colliding with ions as they go.

## Convection

* Liquids and gases are fluids; the particles in these can move from place to place freely.

* Convection occurs when particles with a lot of heat energy (in a liquid or gas) move and take the place of particles with less heat energy.

* Heat energy is transferred from hot places to cooler places by convection.

* Liquids and gases expand when they are heated. This is because the particles in liquids and gases move faster when they are heated than they do when they are cold. As a result, the particles take up more volume. This is because the gap between particles widens, while the particles themselves stay the same size.

* The liquid or gas in hot areas is less dense than the liquid or gas in cold areas, so it rises into the cold areas. The denser cold liquid or gas falls into the warm areas. In this way, convection currents that transfer heat from place to place are set up.
