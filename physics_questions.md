## Hard Drives

> A student has two hard drives

> One is black and one is white.

> The student places the white hard drive on top of the black one, as shown in photograph A.

> The student connects both hard drives to a computer so that thy recieve the same amount of electrical power. The temperature of the hard drives rises as they work.


> The student then rearranges the hard drives so thatthe black one is on top as shown in photograph B.

> ** from Edexcel iGCSE Physics June 2015 P1, question 9**

* Both hard drives pass on heat via conduction, which doesn't differ on the arrangement of them.

* As black emits heat better, it is much more able to **radiate** heat into the surronding area, which may have been transfered originally from the white hard drive via conduction.

* In simpler terms, black is a good emitter, white is a bad emitter.

## Earth and Mars

> State two ways in which the orbits of Earth and Mars are similar

* They both orbit the sun
* They are both eliptical

> State one way in which the orbits of Earth and Mars are different

* They have different orbital radii

## Radioactivity

> The doctor injects a solution of technetium-99m into the patient.

> A detector outside the patient receives the gamma radiation to form the image.

> Suggest why isotopes that emit alpha particles or beta particles are not suitable for this usage.

* Alpha and beta particles would not have sufficient range as they are **highly ionising**,

> Why is alpharr radiation more ionising than beta or gamma radiation?

* In Alpha particles, the charge is larger
* In Alpha particles, the mass is larger

> Why is the detector never zero?

* There is background radiation
* Radioactivity is random

> Suggest why the detector sees a drop in Alpha radiation if there's a fire

* The fire will absorb Alpha radiation
* Particles are generally affected by smoke

## Light and Sound

> What is meant by total internal reflection?

Where the angle of incedense exceedes the critical angle, so all of the light is reflected back into the material.

> Uses of total internal reflection

* Optical fibres for communications via Light
* Optical fibres in decorative lamps

* **sin c = 1/n**

> Two students investigate the speed of sound waves in air.

> They use a stopwatch that shows times to the nearet 0.1 s.

> They use an outdoor running track as their measure of distance

> The track is straight and 100m long.

> Describe what else they must do to obtain a value for the speed of Sound

* Place one student at one end of the running track, with some wood blocks, or another instrument of sound, that will make a noise loud enough to hear clearly from 100m distance.

* Place another student at the opposite end of the running track, then get this student to start the stopwatch when he sees the creation of the sound, e.g. the other student hitting the wood blocks together, then stopping the stopwatch when he hears the sound.

* This is likely hard to do accurately as humans have imperfect reaction speeds.

* Repeat this experiment 5 times or so, then make an average of the time. This can be done by adding all of the times together then dividing by the total amount of times. E.g.

(1s + 2s + 1s + 3s) / 4

* Then use the calculate speed = distance / time, where distance will be 100m.

* They could improve this expiement by using automated equipment, such as microphones connected to an osciliscope.
